## Build and run

Run the exercises using cargo:

* `cargo run` run program for the current day (only makes sense in december)
* `cargo run <day>` run program for the specified day in the current year
* `cargo run <day> <year>` run program for the specified date

## Tests

Each exercise program and the utility code contain a number of
tests to verify correctness. Run them using `cargo test`.
